He began baking the waffles he grew up with at the back of a produce store at Findlay Market. After a few weeks, the store was too congested with waffle-eating-people and the owner of the produce store told Jean-Fran\u00e7ois we needed to find him a new home.</p>\n<p>The little waffle place grew, one waffle at a time to become a new Cincinnati favorite. From one person and a waffle iron, Taste of Belgium expanded into multiple food establishments including a full service restaurant serving breakfast, lunch, dinner and a unique weekend brunch with a large selection of Belgian beers and a wide selection of Genevers (Belgian national alcohol and the mother-of-all-gins).</p>\n<p>Taste of Belgium draws on its Belgian heritage to create a one-of-a-kind, Belgian-inspired, locally infused culinary experience. We thumb our nose at convention and treat our guests and their taste buds to unexpected combinations and unorthodox preparations.</p>\n<p>Belgians would be disturbed by the idea of serving a Li\u00e8ge waffle with fried chicken. The French would be upset that we Belgianized their \u201cgalettes Bretonnes\u201d by adding beer to the buckwheat cr\u00eape batter. And no Cacha\u00e7a will make a caipirinha taste better than the old-grain Belgian Genever we use in preparing our award- winning cocktail at the Bistro.</p>\n<p>We believe elegant cuisine can be served with a down-to-earth attitude and humble foods can be served elegantly. We take the food we create and the service we provide very seriously, but not ourselves.</p>\n","street":"1133 Vine Street","city":"Cincinnati","postal_code":45202,"province":"OH","country":"US","latitude":39.107964,"longitude":-84.514705,"phone":"www.authenticwaffle.com/","created":"2014-10-08 11:01:41","updated":"2015-07-29 09:37:01","active":1,"row":751}},{"hotspot":{"id":5312,"title":"Soup Nation","page_url":"http://www.guyfieri.com/hotspots/tv/soup-nation/","image_url":null,"description":"<p>Eugene, Oregon\u2019s premier\u00a0Soup\u00a0Cafe and Carte: over 80 varieties of local, homemade\u00a0soups!</p>\n<p><a title=\"www.soupnationeugene.com\" href=\"www.soupnationeugene.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.<b>soupnationeugene</b>.com</a></p>\n","street":"525 High Street","city":"Eugene","postal_code":97401,"province":"OR","country":"US","latitude":44.053834,"longitude":-123.087858,"phone":"(541) 683-1999","created":"2014-11-25 03:47:52","updated":"2015-07-29 09:37:01","active":1,"row":752}},{"hotspot":{"id":5136,"title":"Pica\u2019s Mexican Taqueria","page_url":"http://www.guyfieri.com/hotspots/tv/picas-mexican-taqueria/","image_url":"http://www.guyfieri.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/picas-mexican-taqueria-wyoming.jpg","description":"<p><a title=\"www.picastaqueria.com\" href=\"http://www.picastaqueria.com\" target=\"_blank\">Pica\u2019s</a> menu ranges from tacos and burritos to great salads and authentic dishes from different regions of Mexico, all with their homemade corn and flour tortillas.
