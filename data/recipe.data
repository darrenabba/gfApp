Add in the remaining \u00bc cup of garlic oil, add in the flour and stir constantly until a paste forms, allow the roux to cook for 1-2 minutes, with continued stirring, then slowly start adding in the stock. With a whisk, add about \u00bd cup at a time and continue to incorporate, reduce heat to low once mixture has thickened and then add in the reserved cooked garlic cloves.

Warm the filtered water to 90 degrees, dissolve the yeast and set aside for 15 minutes.<\/p>\n<p>Add 1\/2 teaspoon salt to the well along with half the yeast mixture. Working from the center outward, pull the sides of the well into the center until all the flour is incorporated (the mixture will be sticky). Continue to mix the dough and add the remaining yeast in increments until all the yeast mixture is incorporated. Knead the dough until it is elastic, silky and no longer sticky. Add pinches of flour if necessary to reduce the stickiness but do not add too much or the dough will be dry. Knead the dough for 15 minutes.<\/p>\n<p>Shape the dough into a ball and put the dough in a bowl covered with a damp cloth. Let the dough rise at room temperature for 1 hour. Punch down the dough, press out most of the air and shape back into a ball. Let the dough rise for an additional 3 hours. Punch down the dough, form into a ball and refrigerate for 24 to 36 hours to &#8220;retard&#8221; on a sheet tray covered with plastic wrap. When ready, let the dough warm to room temperature for at least 30 minutes before using.<\/p>\n<p>For the pulled prosciutto:<\/p>\n<p>Add the prosciutto end, carrots, onion, celery and garlic to a stockpot and cover with cold water. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat and simmer for 2 hours. Allow the prosciutto to cool in the liquid for 1 hour. Remove the prosciutto, it should be fork tender. Pull the pork for service, discard half the outer skin and mix the rest in with the pulled prosciutto.<\/p>\n<p>For the melted leeks:<\/p>\n<p>Cut the tops off the leeks to the tender part of the leek. Cut the leeks in half, top to bottom. Rinse the leeks well in cool water to remove all the dirt. Cut the leeks into 1\/4-inch half moons. Saute the leeks on medium heat in a large saucepot with the butter. Cook the leeks until very tender, 30 to 40 minutes, stirring as needed. When the leeks are dry, deglaze with the wine. Reduce the wine until almost dry, and then add the cream. Reduce the cream until almost dry. Season with salt and pepper. Allow to cool before adding to the pizza.<\/p>\n<p>For the caramelized onions:<\/p>\n<p>Slice the onion about 1\/4-inch thick. Heat a large saute pan on medium-high heat. Coat the bottom of a pan with oil. Add the onions and stir to coat in oil. Add salt and the sugar. Saute the onions for 10 to 15 minutes. When the onions begin to brown, add the water and cook until evaporated, stirring occasionally. Add the balsamic vinegar and reduce until the onions lose their crunch and the pan is dry. Allow to cool before topping the pizza.<\/p>\n<p>For the cured black olives:<\/p>\n<p>In a large stockpot, bring 1 gallon of water to a boil. Add the olives to a strainer and dip 5 to 6 times in the boiling water to remove the excess salt. Meanwhile, heat the extra-virgin olive oil on medium heat in a saucepan. Add the fresh rosemary and heat in the oil until just fragrant. Remove the pan from the heat and add the olives to the rosemary oil. Allow to cool at room temperature to marinate.

In a pan or flat-top, brown off sausage mixture in about 3 teaspoon bacon fat for flavor. Once sausage mixture is browned, chill immediately.<\/p>\n<p>For the Spinach stuffing:<\/p>\n<p>Melt butter in large skillet. Add all ingredients and saute for 5 minutes until hot. Set aside to cool.<\/p>\n<p>Preparation of the Duck and Chicken:<\/p>\n<p>It is wise to de-bone the duck and chicken first for practice. Place the fresh chicken breast side down on large cutting board. Starting at the bird&#8217;s neck, you will cut through the skin along the length of the spine. Using the tip of the knife and starting from the neck end, separate the meat from rib cage on 1side. Disjoint wing from the shoulder blade and reserve for stock. Work towards the thigh bone, cut through the ball and socket joint and &#8220;pop&#8221; loose using upward pressure with your hand from under bird. Using thumbnail, loosen the &#8220;oyster meat&#8221; (most tender part) from frame. With knife, remove the thigh and leg bone, but keep the leg attached to the bird. Repeat process on other side of chicken.<\/p>\n<p>When both sides are finished, the bird will lay flat. Grab rib cage by the neck area and gently pull towards back to remove entire carcass and breast bone cartilage.<\/p>\n<p>Repeat same de-boning procedure for the duck.<\/p>\n<p>In a well ventilated area or exhaust fan on high, preheat large cast iron pan to very hot.<\/p>\n<p>Rub boneless chicken and duck with olive oil. Generously sprinkle with blackening spice on both sides. Place skin side down in pan for 1 to 2 minutes then turn over and repeat. Refrigerate.<\/p>\n<p>Preparation of turkey:<\/p>\n<p>Using the same de-boning procedure as the chicken and duck with 2 exceptions:<br \/>\nThe turkey wings will be left attached to meat and the bone-in drumstick will be disjointed from the boneless thigh meat and left attached to meat. The final product should be a flat boneless turkey (except for the wings and drumsticks).<\/p>\n<p>To stuff the Turducken:<\/p>\n<p>Place the turkey skin side down on flat surface. Rub meat with 3 tablespoons olive oil. Sprinkle with 2 tablespoons of chopped fresh garlic and 1 tablespoon of blackening spice. Spread an even layer of cornbread dressing over the meat about 3\/4-inch thick and pat down with hands. Spread 1\/4-inch layer of Spinach Stuffing. Sprinkle with 2 cups Andouille Sausage Stuffing. On top, place 6 to 8 slices of roasted red bell peppers.<\/p>\n<p>Place the chilled duck skin side down on top of layered stuffing. Repeat layered stuffing as above.<\/p>\n<p>Arrange chilled chicken skin side down, on top of stuffed duck. Spread remainder of stuffing on top of chicken. Press down gently with hands to compact all ingredients.<\/p>\n<p>To Truss the Turducken:<\/p>\n<p>This may take another person&#8217;s help&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Lift the sides of the turkey together. Have a helper hold the bird closed while sewing the back of the turkey together using butcher&#8217;s twine making the stitches about 1-inch apart, starting at the back of turkey and working towards the neck.<\/p>\n<p>Be careful since the Turducken has no boney frame, roll over breast side up and finish sewing the neck portion of bird. Tie off and cut twine.<\/p>\n<p>Now sew up opening at leg section of turkey. Truss legs together with twine. For extra support, tie butcher&#8217;s twine around the bird&#8217;s width every 3 inches down along the bird&#8217;s length.<\/p>\n<p>Position your hands evenly under the Turducken and lift into a large roasting pan with rack inside. Pan should be at least 3 inches deep to catch drippings during cooking. Rub entire exposed skin of bird with 2 tablespoons of olive oil then sprinkle with 1 tablespoon blackening spice and salt.<\/p>\n<p>Add 1\/2 cup water to bottom of roasting pan. Wrap drumsticks with aluminum foil. Place parchment paper over entire bird. Loosely tent the roasting pan with aluminum foil.<\/p>\n<p>Bake at 200 degrees F for 12 hours or until internal temperature reaches 165 degrees F.<\/p>\n<p>Remove all foil and parchment paper the last hour of roasting time and turn up temperature to 325 degrees F. Baste with drippings. When done, remove from oven and let set in roasting pan for at least 1 hour. With 2 heavy duty spatulas, insert underneath and remove Turducken from rack to place on carving platter. Remove all butcher twine&#8230;including pulling out the portion along the spine.<\/p>\n<p>To serve, cut Turducken in half lengthwise, then cut servings crosswise in approximately 1-inch thicknesses. Serve with gravy and enjoy.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"For the Andouille Sausage Stuffing In a large bowl, mix the ingredients, except the bacon fat, with some cold water.

Continue mixing until dough is smooth, about 10 to 15 minutes.<\/p>\n<p>Allow the dough to cool, then wrap with plastic wrap and set aside at room temperature. This dough needs to set up overnight at least, but can rest up to 2 months.<\/p>\n<p>For Spice Dough:<\/p>\n<p>Dissolve the baker&#8217;s ammonia in the water in a large mixing bowl of a stand mixer. Add the eggs and corn syrup and mix until combined.<\/p>\n<p>Sift the flour and spices in a separate large mixing bowl and gradually add the flour mixture to the wet mixture using a bread hook on the electric mixer. The dough will become very stiff; do not overmix, simply incorporate the flour.<\/p>\n<p>Cut the honey dough into 3 portions and add it into the spice dough, 1 portion at a time. You need to make sure that the honey dough and spice dough&#8217;s are completely combined. To make sure that they are, you must knead the dough by hand in a fold-and-press motion on a lightly floured work surface. This will take a long time, but is totally necessary.<\/p>\n<p>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Divide dough into 4 equal portions. Lightly flour your work surface and work with 1 portion at a time. Using a rolling pin, roll the dough out until it&#8217;s about 1\/4-inch thick. While rolling, flour the work surface and rolling pin, as needed.<\/p>\n<p>Using your gingerbread house template, cut out desired shapes with a floured butter knife. Transfer the shapes to a greased cookie sheet or sheets, using a large floured spatula, placing them 1-inch apart. Reroll the scraps to make the additional cookies or decorations used for the gingerbread house.<\/p>\n<p>Lightly brush dough with milk and bake until firm to the touch in the center and the edges begin to darken, 10 to 14 minutes. If the dough begins to bubble at all, pierce it with a toothpick to remove the air, and then carefully smooth out the surface. Remove the house pieces from the oven and allow to completely cool on the cookie sheet.<\/p>\n<p>For Royal Icing:<\/p>\n<p>Do not begin to make the icing until the gingerbread house pieces are completely cooled and you are prepared to assemble the house.<\/p>\n<p>Beat the egg whites until light and fluffy, about 5 to 7 minutes, in a large mixing bowl using an electric mixer on medium speed.<\/p>\n<p>Gradually add the confectioners&#8217; sugar and cream of tartar; beat until combined.<\/p>\n<p>Add the lemon juice and beat on high until the mixture forms stiff, glossy peaks, at least 5 to 7 minutes.<\/p>\n<p>When finished, cover the icing with plastic wrap, making sure that the wrap touches the icing completely.<\/p>\n<p>For Gingerbread House:<\/p>\n<p>Cut out a large cardboard base that is large enough for your gingerbread house and strong enough to hold the weight. Cover it with aluminum foil or wrapping paper.<\/p>\n<p>Spoon some of the royal icing into a pastry bag fitted with 1\/4 to 3\/8-inch diameter tip. Keep the remaining icing covered so it does not dry out.<\/p>\n<p>Assemble the walls of the house, piping thick lines of the icing onto the sides of the walls that meet. Use cans of food to support the walls when drying. If the edges of the pieces are not straight, you will need to cut them. If they are not smooth, you can run a nutmeg grater over the edge to smooth it out. Allow the icing to dry completely before attaching the roof pieces.<\/p>\n<p>Once the roof is secured and the icing is dry, you may decorate the house with the remaining icing, cookies and candies as desired.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"For Honey Dough: In a large saucepan, bring the honey to a boil over medium heat.
